# RasterRizer
Help's to create a 2D crochet-pattern by rasterizing hi-res images and raster-editing-tools

RasterRizer is a Desktop-Application based on Java Swing.

Components:
=============
This tool has a Main-Window, Create-Raster-Window and a View-Window:

Main-Window:
  on the main-grid you can edit the raster-image, wich can be loaded by the Create-Raster-Window (click "Rasterbild erstellen...")
    - drawing on raster by dragging the mousecursor
   
Create-Raster-Window (Title: "Bild landen")
  an template-image can be loaded and placed on the grid.
  by adjusting the template-image size, raster-size or tile-size, you can create a optimal raster-image to work with in the Main-Window
   - colors in the colorlist can be removed and added, to define the colors that should be used in the raster-image
      -> the colors on the raster-image will be automatically updated, regarding to the colorlist 
  
View-Window:
  can be opend from the Main-Window by clicking "anzeigen". the View-Window can only be opend if there is a Rasterimage in the main-grid.
  you can highlight the rows by moving the highlighter with arrow down/up
  
  
How to use:
==========
Application starts alway with the Main-Window...
1) in Main-Window click "Rasterbild erstellen.."
2) in Create-Raster-Window (Title: "Bild landen") load template-image from filesystem by filechooser (click "Bild laden") OR drag'n'drop image-file on grid
3) adjust raster-image by moving and scaling the template-imgage OR scaling the rastersize and gridsize
4) click "Ãœbernehmen" -> the raster-image is now on the main-grid in the main-window
5) darw on the main grid with the selected color to edit the raster-image
  -> color can be picked by clicking with the right mousebutton on a tile on the main-grid or with the left mouse-button on a color on the color-grid
6) save raster-image by clicking "speichern" 
7) view the raster-image by clicking "anzeigen", and enjoy your crouchet-pattern :)


There are some other features:
- redo/undo, in Main-Window and Create-Raster-Window
- colorlist/palett
- save/load raster-image
- zoom in main-grid (+/-)buttons
- zoom in view-window by scrolling
